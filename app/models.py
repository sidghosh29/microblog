Flask-SQLAlchemy uses a "snake case" naming convention for database tables by default. 
For the User model below, the corresponding table in the database will be named user. 
For a AddressAndPhone model class, the table would be named address_and_phone. 
If you prefer to choose your own table names, you can add an attribute named __tablename__ 
to the model class, set to the desired name as a string.

    '''
    The User model has a posts relationship attribute that was configured with the WriteOnlyMapped generic type. 
    This is a special type of relationship that adds a select() method that returns a database query for the related items. 
    The u.posts.select() expression takes care of generating the query that links the user to its blog posts.

    Also note, so.WriteOnlyMapped['Post'] encloses the Post class name in single quotes. 
    This is necessary because the Post class is not yet defined. When a class needs to reference another class 
    that is defined below it, you cannot write the name directly, because Python will give you an error. 
    This is called a "forward reference". SQLAlchemy allows you to enter forward references as strings. 
    When the Post class references 'User', it is not a forward reference because 'User' is defined above 'Post', 
    so in that case a string is not necessary (but if you want to be consistent you can use a string on that one as well).

    When you pass a function as a default, SQLAlchemy will set the field to the value returned by the function.
    In general, you will want to work with UTC dates and times in a server application instead of the local time 
    where you are located. This ensures that you are using uniform timestamps regardless of where the users and 
    the server are located. These timestamps will be converted to the user's local time when they are displayed.

    "2021-06-28T21:45:23+00:00" is the format for ISO 8601 dates and times. The "+00:00" part at the end 
    of the string represents timezone offset from UTC and +00:00 means UTC. For instance, +05:30 offset 
    would mean 5 hours 30 minutes ahead of UTC (India Standard Time). Knowing this info will be important when
    we display the date and time on the web page.
