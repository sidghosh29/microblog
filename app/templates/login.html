<form action="" method="post" novalidate>
    <!--
        When the action is set to an empty string the form is submitted to the URL that is currently in the address bar

        The novalidate attribute is used to tell the web browser to not apply validation to the fields
        in this form, which effectively leaves this task to the Flask application running in the server. 
        Using novalidate is entirely optional, but for this first form it is important that you set it 
        because this will allow you to test server-side validation later.
        -->
    {{ form.hidden_tag() }}
    <!--
        The form.hidden_tag() template argument generates a hidden field that includes a token that is used to
        protect the form against CSRF attacks. All you need to do to have the form protected is include this hidden
        field and have the SECRET_KEY variable defined in the Flask configuration. 
        If you take care of these two things, Flask-WTF does the rest for you.
